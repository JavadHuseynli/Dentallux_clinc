# Adding Your Dental Images to the Website

You've provided 6 dental/medical images. Here's how to add them to your website:

## Step 1: Save the Images

Save your images to the following locations with these exact names:

1. **Image #1** (Woman with shade guide) → Save as:
   - `public/images/hero/main-dentist.jpg`
   - This will be used in the Hero section

2. **Image #2** (Dentist treating patient) → Save as:
   - `public/images/services/general-dentistry.jpg`
   - For General Dentistry service

3. **Image #3** (Doctor with patients) → Save as:
   - `public/images/services/emergency-dentistry.jpg`
   - For Emergency Dentistry service

4. **Image #4** (Close-up dental work) → Save as:
   - `public/images/services/cosmetic-dentistry.jpg`
   - For Cosmetic Dentistry service

5. **Image #5** (Dental tools/treatment) → Save as:
   - `public/images/services/orthodontics.jpg`
   - For Orthodontics service

6. **Image #6** (Smiling patient) → Save as:
   - `public/images/testimonials/patient-1.jpg`
   - For Testimonials section

## Step 2: Optimize Images

Before saving, optimize your images using:
- https://tinypng.com/
- Or https://squoosh.app/

Recommended dimensions:
- Hero image: 500x550px
- Service images: 350x200px
- Testimonial images: 100x100px (circular)

## Step 3: I'll Update the Code

Once you've saved the images, I'll update the components to use them instead of the SVG placeholders.

## Quick Reference:

```
public/
  images/
    hero/
      main-dentist.jpg          ← Image #1
    services/
      general-dentistry.jpg     ← Image #2
      emergency-dentistry.jpg   ← Image #3
      cosmetic-dentistry.jpg    ← Image #4
      orthodontics.jpg          ← Image #5
    testimonials/
      patient-1.jpg             ← Image #6
```

## Next Steps:

1. Download/save all 6 images to your computer
2. Optimize them with TinyPNG
3. Create the folders if they don't exist
4. Save images with the exact names above
5. Let me know when done, and I'll update the code!
